\chapter{Pixel RawDataAnalysis framework}
This chapter presents the RawDataAnalysis framework which is a software system used in ATLAS pixel detector for the analysis of raw data. The framework is used to perform the conversion of raw data into a format that is suitable for further analysis. This is not part of the ATLAS athena framework which is originally used for physics analysis, rather this framework is used for any quick analysis of raw data for debugging of the pixel detector data acquisition system.
