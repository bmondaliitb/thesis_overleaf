\chapter{Pixel RawDataAnalysis framework}
This chapter presents the RawDataAnalysis framework which is a software system used in ATLAS pixel detector for the analysis of raw data. The framework is used to perform the conversion of raw data into a format that is suitable for further analysis. This is not part of the ATLAS athena framework which is used for object reconstruction and further physics analysis, rather this framework is used for any quick analysis of raw data for debugging of the pixel detector data acquisition system. This work doesn't go with the main goal of the thesis, rather it is a part of another project during the author's time at CERN. The framework is written in C++ and python.
