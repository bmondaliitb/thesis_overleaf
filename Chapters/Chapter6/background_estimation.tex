\chapter{Background estimation}
\label{chap:background_estimation}

The signal and background processes in this analysis are modeled using the MC simulation. The simulated events are divided into categories based on the photon origin. These categories are prompt photons, fake photons, and non-prompt leptons. The prompt photons are the photons that are produced in the hard scattering process. The prompt photons are estimated using the MC simulation. The fake photons are the photons that are some other object mis-reconstructed as photon or the photon that is produced in the decay of the hadrons. The fakes are further categorized, there are events in which an electron is misidentified as photon, this is referred as \efake events~\cref{sec:background-estimation-efake}. Also there are events in which jet is misreconstructed as photon, or the origin of photon is hadron decay, this is referred as \hfake events~\cref{sec:background-estimation-hfake}. For the fake photon events, the MC estimates are further correced using the data-driven methods.  Also after applying event selection, there are events with non-prompt leptons in which the origin of the lepton is not hard scattering. The contribution of these events in our measurement phase space is estimated using the data-driven matrix method detailed in~\cref{sec:background-estimation-lfake}.
