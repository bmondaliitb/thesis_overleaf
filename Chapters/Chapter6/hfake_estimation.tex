\section{\hfake background estimation}
\label{sec:background-estimation-hfake}

Photon is reconstructed from the EM calorimeter clusters. The improper reconstruction and identification of photon can lead to misreconstruction of jet as photon. Also the photon coming from hadron decay can be misidentified and these events can enter our measurement. Together these events are referred as \hfake events. Mismodeling of these events is seen in MC when compared with the data. The scale factor is obtained by taking the ratio of the \hfake events in data and MC. The scale factor is then applied to the MC to correct for the mismodeling.
