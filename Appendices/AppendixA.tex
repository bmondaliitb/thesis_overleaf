\section{Choice of binning}
\label{sec:binning_optimization_study}

In this section, we show for few observables the unfolded results (considering only statistical uncertainty)
for a test setup and final setup for the \tty production and \tty prod+decay measurements. Additionally, we also show the migration matrix of events
from particle bin to reconstruction level in the signal region for the setups. In general no major differences are observed.
